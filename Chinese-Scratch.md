# We need Scratch !!!
For the Chinese, Scratch is important, but it was blocked by the Chinese government on August 27, 2020, which cause huge economic losses and panic to users on Scratch and the Scratch company.

The Chinese did something on Scratch that did not meet the requirements of China, such as "China and Taiwan are two countries" etc.

For the American Scratch team, they have come up with some methods, such as "using VPN", "switching countries and regions", using "TCP loopholes", etc., but in fact, not all Scratch users learn to use these methods.

The Chinese have no choice, because in China, the Chinese are not allowed to march or demonstrate, so the Chinese are helpless. I hope everyone will publish more articles about Scratch being blocked by China. Let us â€œtell the Chinese government on the Internet: We need Scratch!!!"
