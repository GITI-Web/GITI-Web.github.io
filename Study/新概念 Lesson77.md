NURSE: Good morning. Mr. Croft.

MR. CROFT: Good morning, nurse.

I was to see the dentist,

please.

NURSE: Do you have an appointment?

MR. CROFT: No, I don't.

NURSE: Is it urgent?

MR. CROFT: Yes, it is.

It's very urgent.

I feel awful.

I have a terrible toothache.

NURSE: Can you come at 10 a.m.

on Monday, April 24th?

MR. CROFT: I must see the dentist now,

nurse.

NURSE: The dentist is very busy

at the moment.

Can you come at 2 p.m.?

MR. CROFT: That's very late.

Can the dentist see me now?

NURSE: I'm afraid that he can't,

Mr. Croft.

Can't you wait till this

afternoon?

MR. CROFT: I can wait, but my toothache

can't!
